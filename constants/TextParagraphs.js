  "Some common ways of talking to angry, sad or upset persons might make them feel worse or more upset. These are some communication methods to avoid when you want to help another person calm down or feel better.",

  "*   Meeting an aggressive person with aggression",
  "If a person has acted badly, you may feel the need to put your foot down to let them know that their behavior is not acceptable. This instinct makes empathic communication harder to achieve afterwards. Even if you don’t agree with the person or don’t even like the person – choosing a road of empathy and really trying to understand the person’s feelings and perspective is usually the fastest way to get to a safe and calm situation for both of you. You can tell the person to stop their bad behaviour - do your best to say it in a neutral and non-judgemental way.",

  "*   Telling the person to calm down",
  "Getting asked to calm down is normally understood by the person as critique, rather than understanding and respect. This can make the person much more upset.",

  "*   Advice or opinions too soon ",
  "A person who is upset is generally not ready for or interested in your advice. Not until they start feeling calmer and understood are they ready to hear your opinion or advice.",

  "*   Sharing your experiences too soon",
  "Common experiences can be helpful to hear, but do not share your own experiences until you have listened, validated and the person feels understood and calm. ",

  "*   Minimizing the problem",
  "We often want to tell a person that their problems are actually not that bad, and that they should not be so worried. Even if you care deeply about the person, telling them that their feelings are too strong and that the problem is not so big can make the person feel a lot worse.",

  "*   Distracting the person",
  "Changing the topic or trying to make the person think about something else can be helpful - but it can also make the person frustrated, since they might feel like you donot care about listening to them.",

  //step 1
  "Step 1",
  "Breathe in and out \n with the circle...",
  "Our instincts often get in the way of making smart decisions under pressure. To help someone else become calm - we often need to start with calming ourselves. Try to pause and breathe for at least six seconds before you start responding to the upset person.",
  // read more
  "There are multiple breathing methods to calm down your nervous system. Our favorite one is is called a physiological sigh. You breathe in twice, ideally through the nose - filling your lungs completely with air - and then breathe our slowly through your mouth. Do this a few times for a quick calming effect.",

  //step 2
  "Step 2",
  "Listen or ask clarifying questions",
  "Listen to the other person to understand their perspective. Really listen and believe the person - try not to focus on your own opinions, or how to solve the  person's problems. Even if you disagree with what is being said - take the time to really listen, before moving on to step 3.",
  //read more
  'If the person is not talking, you can ask non-judgmental questions, such as "What are you feeling?", "What\'s going on?" or "I am here to listen, if you want to talk?"',
  "Sometimes questions might make the person feel criticized, which might make the person more upset. This is why we only recommend using questions to clarify, in cases when the person is silent or very hard to understand.",

  //step 3

  "Validate the person's feelings",
  'Notice what the person is feeling, and put it into words. "You are angry." "You are sad." "You feel betrayed." "You are disappointed at me."',
  //read more
  'It should be said as a neutral statement, not as a question. This particular part of the method can feel strange, but it can have a very strong positive effect and calm the other person down fast. What you are signalling to the other person with your statement is "I understand and accept your feelings. Your feelings are valid."',
  "We especially recommend to validate feelings in this way in cases where the person is completely out of control - you may need to stay in this step for quite some time to help them calm down. This step can also be skipped, if it feels unnecessary or unnatural in the situation.",

  //alert1
  "What if I don's  agree with the person?",
  "A person can be right or wrong for their actions, but they are never right or wrong for how they feel. Their feelings are real for them, and valid. Respecting their right to their feelings makes it much easier to solve conflict and help the other person calm down - regardless of whether you agree with them or not.",
  "Got it!",

  //alert 2

  'The person will correct you if you guess wrong. "I am not angry, I am just disappointed." then you simply try again with the correct feeling "Ok, you\'re disappointed.',

  "Won't the person be more upset if I \n                  say this to them?",
  "After using this method for many years, we can confidently say that people usually do not even notice that you are doing it. All the person notices is that they feel calmer in your presence. However, this step can be skipped, if it doesn't feel natural or necessary in the situation.",

  //step 4
  "Step 4",
  "Summarize without judgement",
  "Repeat what the person just said, in a very brief summary, in a tone that shows that you don’t judge them.",
  "By explaining what you heard them say, you show them that you understand and listen. This will make the person feel heard, respected and important, and this will help them calm down.",

For example, you can ask: “Can I tell you what I would do in your situation?” or "Can I tell you how this situation made me feel?". Wait for a yes – and then explain your opinions or feelings. If the person says no – ask why or say “Ok, no problem. Let me know if you need me.” If you don’t have any good advice or don\'t want to share your thoughts – skip this step.',
